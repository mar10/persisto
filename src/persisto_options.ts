/**
 * Available options for [[PersistentObject]].
 *
 * Options are passed to the constructor as plain object:
 *
 * ```js
 * let store = new mar10.PersistentObject("test", {
 *   storage: sessionStorage,  // Default: localStorage
 *   attachForm: "#form1",
 *   defaults: {
 *     title: "foo",
 *     ...
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Events may be handled by passing a handler callback option:
 *
 * ```js
 * let store = new mar10.PersistentObject("mySettings", {
 *   [...]
 *   change: function(hint){
 *     alert("Store " + this + " was changed. Reason: " + hint);
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
